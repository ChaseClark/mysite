        <!-- This is information about my webpage -->
        <p>This website is going to be for a local event planning business. My plan for this site is to have a color scheme
            tailored for a female audience, images showcasing their business, and pricing/services information. Also, I will
            make sure that the page is responsive for all desktop screen sizes, as well as for mobile phone screens.</p>
